# Hot Wire Anemometer

Anemometer design using two temperature sensors, one of which is self heated. The energy deposited to maintain a fixed temperature increase over the non-heated sensor is used to determine air velocity.

Sensors:
* Sensor type
  * RTD, typically PT100 or PT1000, thin-film type
  * Thermistor, typically NTC glass-bead type
* Low mass to achieve fast thermal response
* Low Â°C/mW self heating value
